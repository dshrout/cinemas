# Cinemas

This app uses data from TheMovieDB.org. To access the movie information from TMDB you must have an API Key from them.

To get and API Key, navigate to www.themoviedb.org and create a free user account. Then check under the API section to request an API Key.

Once you have your own API Key, you'll need to add it to the project to run Cinemas.
In the Cinemas class there is a private member variable named TMDB_API_KEY. Set your key as the value of this variable and you are ready to rock-n-roll.
